"""
Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
Return the interÂ­secting node. Note that the intersection is defined based
on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list
is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked
list, then they are intersecting.
